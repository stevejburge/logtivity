Logtivity is the best activity log plugin for WordPress. Keep accurate activity logs of everything happening on your WordPress site.

== Description ==

<strong>Logtivity is an activity log that helps you understand exactly what’s happening on your WordPress site.</strong><br /> 

[Logtivity](https://logtivity.io) is the best activity log for WordPress. You can record all the user activity on your site. Then you can turn your activity logs into beautiful, useful charts. You can also use the activity log data to send notifications to email or Slack. Plus, you can easily search and export the information.

If you have customers on your WordPress site, you’ll find Logtivity to be invaluable. Because Logtivity records all the important activity, you can see real customer journeys across your WordPress site. This can be incredibly helpful for customer support: the activity log will show exactly what a user has done on your site.

To get started, simply install the Logtivity plugin and then connect your site to [Logtivity](https://logtivity.io). You’ll immediately start to see the results. You will see everything this user has done from installing plugins and updating posts, to changing blocks and plugin settings.

### Join Logtivity and Start Your Activity Log ###

> <strong>Logtivity is a SaaS service</strong><br />
> You will need to create a Logtivity account to store your activity logs. <a href="https://app.logtivity.io/register" rel="friend" title="Logtivity">Click here to get started with Logtivity!</a>

### Logtivity is an Activity Log and Much More! ###

Yes, Logtivity will keep a record of the activity on your website. However, that’s just where the magic begins. You can then use your data in Logtivity and do three additional things:

* Create beautiful activity log charts to visualize your data.
* Send alert notifications to Slack and email.
* Easily export activity log reports to CSV files, no matter how many logs you have.

Here’s an introduction to those three options, showing why Logtivity is the best activity log plugin for WordPress:

### Create beautiful charts from your activity log

The image on the top of this page shows what's possible with Logtivity. First, I searched my site’s data for file downloads and then clicked the “Convert to Report” button. Logtivity did the rest. With a couple of mouse clicks, I’ve created a chart showing all the daily file downloads.

Logtivity customers can build a whole dashboard full of charts, so you can quickly see the number of logins, downloads, payments and anything else that's important to you.

### Send Email and Slack notifications for user activity

Once your site is connected to Logtivity, you can set up unlimited alerts for any activity you want to know about as soon as it happens. You can send the alerts to your inbox or Slack channel.

One Logtivity customer employs various writers, so they’ve set up a series of Slack alerts that show when the writers log in. You can use this as a security alert, letting you know every time someone in the Administrator role logs in.

Another customer sends themselves an email every time a plugin or theme is updated. They only run updates on Monday, but realized that some plugins will run their own auto-updates. Logtivity allows them to be constantly aware of all site changes. A third customer sends themselves an alert every time there have been no plugin updates in the last week! They want to make sure they don’t forget to run updates.

eCommerce sites can use Logtivity for convenient notifications and set up alerts for all new, changed, and canceled subscriptions. Click here to see more about alerts.

### Export user activity logs to CSV

Logtivity was started because one of our clients had reporting problems due to the amount of data collected on their site. The client was using a plugin that stored data in the WordPress database. Whenever we tried to export large amounts of logs, the site would show 502 errors. We needed to have the information stored separately. Being a dedicated service, Logtivity can optimize for things such as exporting 100,000 logs.

### Activity logs for WordPress user logins

It’s important to havee an activity log on your WordPress site. You need to know many people are visiting, making purchases, and logging in to your site. Yes, you can track visitors with Google Analytics, and you can track purchases with your payment gateway, but it’s harder to track WordPress-specific information such as log ins. Using Logtivity, you can get an overview of who is logging in to your site, and how many people are logging in every day.

If Logtivity is active on your site, you can go to the “Logs” screen and search for all the “User Logged in” events. You can use the search boxes to drill down for more specific information. For example, you can use the “Context” box to search for a particular user role. You can use this to search for all "Administrator" logins or all "Editor" logins.

You can also use the search option as a security log and look for nefarious patterns in the audit logs. For example, you can search by IP address to see if one person is using multiple logins. Or you can search by username to see if one account is being shared by different people.
